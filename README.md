# Project-WalkSafe

Project WalkSafe is a data science project focused on making cities safer for pedestrians. Using real crash data from Chicago, we analyzed when and where pedestrian accidents are most likely to occur. We used Python and mapping tools to clean and filter data, find patterns, perform EDA, and create multiple visualizations to highlight possible trends and correlations. Finally, we performed ML analyses to identify pedestrian crash hotspots in different neighborhoods, determine the best features that impact pedestrian incidents, and analyze whether speed cameras were an effective traffic device tool for reducing pedestrian crash incidents. We used various models and techniques, mainly from packages such as scikit-learn and SciPy. The goal was to turn hefty raw data into something useful and draw potential conclusions and insights to help city planners, researchers, or even everyday people make smarter, safer decisions about where they walk.

### How to Use This Project
You can explore our data exploration, visualizations, hypotheses, ML analyses, and final results by exploring `final_report.ipynb`.

### Data Sources
We derived data from the following public datasets provided by the city of Chicago:

[Speed Camera Violations](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Speed-Camera-Violations/hhkd-xvj4/about_data)

[Traffic Crashes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data)

[Chicago Traffic Tracker](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Chicago-Traffic-Tracker-Congestion-Estimates-by-Se/n4j6-wkkf/about_data)
